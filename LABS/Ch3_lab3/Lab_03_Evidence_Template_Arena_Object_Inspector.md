# Chapter 03 – Practical Lab 03 – Evidence
## Arena Object Inspector

**Student ID:** [complete]  
**Date (YYYY-MM-DD):** [complete]  
**Visual Studio version:** [complete]  
**Repository link (if used):** [complete / not used]

Build settings: v145 · C++17 · `/W4` · `/GR` · `/EHsc` · Debug · x64

Complete this file as you work. Short answers and relevant console excerpts are enough. Do not invent extra tests or take screenshots unless your lecturer specifically requests them. Never run an unsafe cast or a dangling-pointer experiment.

## 01 · Project setup

- [ ] Created an Empty Project named `ArenaObjectInspectorLab`.
- [ ] Added `Main.cpp`, `ArenaObjects.h`, `ArenaObjects.cpp`, `Inspector.h` and `Inspector.cpp`.
- [ ] Selected C++17, `/W4`, `/GR`, `/EHsc`, Debug and x64.
- [ ] The starting project built and printed `Arena object inspector`.

**If a build problem occurred, what did you fix?**  
[one sentence / no problem recorded]

## 02 · Shared virtual behaviour

**Which class is abstract, and why?**  
[one sentence]

**What does `EliteGuard` inherit from `Guard`?**  
[one sentence]

**Shared behaviour output:**

```text
[paste the Shared behaviour section from your console]
```

**Why can `selected->report()` call the correct function for all three objects?**  
[one sentence]

## 03 · Checked Guard views

Before running, predict what `readGuardHealth` returns:

| Argument | My prediction | Actual |
|---|---|---|
| `&guard` | [complete] | [complete] |
| `&elite` | [complete] | [complete] |
| `&crate` | [complete] | [complete] |
| `nullptr` | [complete] | [complete] |

**Why must the cast result be checked before calling `health()`?**  
[one sentence]

**Does a successful cast create a new Guard object or owner?**  
[yes/no and one sentence]

## 04 · Exact types

**Record the five exact-type checks shown in the lab:**

```text
[paste the Exact type checks section]
```

**Why is `EliteGuard` Guard-compatible but not exactly `Guard`?**  
[one or two sentences]

**How do `typeid(selected)` and `typeid(*selected)` differ?**  
[one sentence, assuming selected is a live, non-null polymorphic view]

## 05 · Checked references

**Record the two reference-cast results:**

```text
[paste the Reference casts section]
```

**What does a failed checked `Guard const&` conversion do, and which exception is caught?**  
[one sentence]

## 06 · Mixed selection

**Predictions (before running):**

- Guard-compatible objects: [complete]
- Exact Guard objects: [complete]
- Empty selection result: [complete]
- Positive count with null array result: [complete]

**Actual output:**

```text
[paste the Selection section]
```

**Which checks run before indexing the selection array?**  
[one or two sentences]

**Why is a null-element guard required before `typeid(*slot)`?**  
[one sentence]

## 07 · Virtual function definition investigation

**Was the temporary error observed during compilation or linking?**  
[complete]

**What definition was missing?**  
[complete]

**What did you restore to fix the build?**  
[one sentence]

## 08 · Final console output

```text
[paste the complete final output here]
```

- [ ] The output matches the practical's final expected result.
- [ ] The temporary missing-definition experiment has been reversed.
- [ ] The final Debug/x64 project builds successfully.

**One key difference between a compatible derived view and exact runtime type:**  
[one or two sentences]

## Optional stretch · Object size

Only if attempted: record `sizeof` values and compiler/build settings. Explain why they do not establish a portable vtable size or member offset.

[not attempted / measurements and explanation]

### Final checklist

- [ ] I wrote and understood the class definitions and member-function bodies.
- [ ] I used `dynamic_cast` with safe failure handling.
- [ ] I compared exact runtime types using `typeid`, not class-name strings.
- [ ] I handled a failed reference cast using `std::bad_cast`.
- [ ] I validated the selection count and skipped null slots.
- [ ] I fixed and documented the missing virtual function definition.
- [ ] I restored the final program and obtained the expected output.
